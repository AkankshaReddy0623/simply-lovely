1. 📱 YOUR APP: Every time a user does something (login, download, etc.)
   → Your app sends a message to Third Umpire

2. 🤖 AI ANALYSIS: Third Umpire's AI looks at the activity and thinks:
   → "Is this normal behavior for this user?"
   → "Does this look suspicious?"
   → "Should I alert the security team?"

3. 🚨 ALERTS: If something looks suspicious:
   → Third Umpire immediately creates a security alert
   → Shows it on the dashboard
   → Can send notifications to security team

4. 📊 DASHBOARD: Security teams can:
   → See all current alerts
   → Look at user activity history
   → Investigate suspicious behavior
   → Take action if needed

Think of it like having a security guard who never sleeps and watches
every user on your website 24/7!
